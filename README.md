### Design Brief
Website called Rango that lets users browse through user-defined categories to access various web pages. 
In Spanish, the word rango is used to mean “a league ranked by quality” or “a position in a social hierarchy” 
(see https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/es/rango).

For the main page of the site, visitors able to see:
the 5 most viewed pages;
the five most rango’ed categories; and some way for visitors to browse or search through categories.
When a user views a category page, they would like it to display:
the category name, the number of visits, the number of likes;
along with the list of associated pages in that category (showing the page’s title and linking to its url); and.
some search functionality (via Bing’s Search API) to find other pages that can be linked to this category.
For a particular category, the client would like the name of the category to be recorded, the number of times each category page has been visited,
and how many users have clicked a “like” button (i.e. the page gets rango’ed, and voted up the social hierarchy).

Each category should be accessible via a readable URL - for example, /rango/books-about-django/.

Only registered users will be able to search and add pages to categories. And so, visitors to the site should be able to register for an account.
